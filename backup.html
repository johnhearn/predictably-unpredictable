                Randomness? Maybe, but there is something more...
                ... does probability help us make better decisions? Maybe...
                People are unpredictable.. 
                ... but cognitive bias, should make us MORE predictable, in fact AI has been able to learn our biases when playing games with us.

                There's are books written about all of those but let's look at another reason.
